# The LOCAL directory where the WireGuard certificates are stored after they

# (the user that run's "ansible-playbook" command) plus
# "/wireguard/certs". That means if the user's ${HOME} directory is e.g.
# "/home/da_user" then "wireguard_cert_directory" will have a value of
# "/home/da_user/wireguard/certs". If you change this make sure that
# the parent directory is writable by the user that runs "ansible-playbook"
# command.
