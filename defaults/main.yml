# By default a WireGuard configuration file in "wireguard_remote_directory"
# directory will be created that is called like the value of "wireguard_interface"
# plus ".conf". If "wireguard_ubuntu_use_netplan" is set to "true" this should
# be changed to "70-{{ wireguard_interface }}.yaml" e.g.
wireguard_conf_filename: "{{ wireguard_interface }}.conf"

# The default group of the wg.conf file

# By default "wg syncconf" is used to apply WireGuard interface settings if
# they've changed. Older WireGuard tools doesn't provide this option. In that
# case as a fallback the WireGuard interface will be restarted. This causes a
# short interruption of network connections.
#
# So even if "false" is the default, the role figures out if the "syncconf"
# option of the "wg" utility is available and if not falls back to "true"
# (which means interface will be restarted as this is the only possible option
# in this case).
#
# Possible options:
# - false (default)
# - true
#
# Both options have their pros and cons. The default "false" option (do not
# restart interface)
# - does not need to restart the WireGuard interface to apply changes
# - does not cause a short VPN connection interruption when changes are applied
# - might cause network routes are not properly reloaded
#
# Setting the option value to "true" will
# - restart the WireGuard interface as the name suggests in case of changes
# - cause a short VPN connection interruption when changes are applied
# - make sure that network routes are properly reloaded
#
# So it depends a little bit on your setup which option works best. If you
# don't have an overly complicated routing that changes very often or at all
# using "false" here is most properly good enough for you. E.g. if you just
# want to connect a few servers via VPN and it normally stays this way.
#
# If you have a more dynamic routing setup then setting this to "true" might be
# the safest way to go. Also if you want to avoid the possibility creating some
# hard to detect side effects this option should be considered.
